## Installation

Clone or download this repository to your local machine

## Development

This game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and you can see most of my code in the [app.js](js/app.js) file in this repository. Whilst building it I further improved the following skills:

* [x] Object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS)
* [x] ES6 (especially the use of classes and template literals/strings)
* [x] DOM manipulation
* [x] CSS styling
* [x] JavaScript game development (especially 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms)

## Acknowledgements

This was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3] - they provided the game engine and resources and then I used my OOJS and other skills to develop it. Udacity' lessons, code reviews and feedback were invaluable.
