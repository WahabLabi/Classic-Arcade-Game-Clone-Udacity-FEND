- You control an avatar and your aim is to reach the water by crossing the busy thoroughfare whilst evading the bugs
- Choose your avatar by clicking on one of the five provided and then move it using your keyboard arrow keys
- You have three lives
- Success (reaching the water) = 10 points
- Failure (being hit by a bug) = having a life and one point deducted and then restarting
- The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every success or failure

## Access and Installation

You can play the game by [clicking here][1] or by cloning/downloading this repo and then opening the index.html file

## Development

This game was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. They provided the game engine and resources and then I used my object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) skills to make it work perfectly.

Skills developed:

* [x] OOJS
* [x] ES6 (especially the use of classes)
* [x] DOM manipulation
* [x] CSS styling
* [x] Game development (especially 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms)
