- You control an avatar and your aim is to reach the water by crossing the busy thoroughfare whilst evading the bugs
- Choose your avatar by clicking on one of the five provided and then move it using your keyboard arrow keys
- You have three lives
- Success (reaching the water) = 10 points
- Failure (being hit by a bug) = having a life and one point deducted and then restarting
- The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every success or failure

## Installation

Clone or download this repository to your local machine

## Development

This game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and you can see most of my code in the [app.js](js/app.js) file in this repository. Whilst building it I further improved the following skills:

* [x] Object-oriented JavaScript
* [x] ES6 (especially the use of classes, arrow functions and template literals/strings)
* [x] DOM manipulation
* [x] CSS styling
* [x] JavaScript game development (especially 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms)

## Acknowledgements

This was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. Udacity provided the game engine and resources and then I developed the game using my object-oriented JavaScript skills. Udacity' code reviews and feedback were invaluable.
