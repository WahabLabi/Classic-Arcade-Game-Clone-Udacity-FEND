# Udacity-FEND-arcade-game

This is a game based on the arcade hit Frogger.

You start on the grass and your aim is to cross the busy road (without getting hit by one of the bugs that are going along it) and reach the water' edge on the other side safely.

If you're successful then you'll get 10 points - HOORAY! Otherwise if you're hit by a bug then you'll lose a life, a point and have to restart.

You can choose one of five characters at any time and have three lives. You use your keyboard arrow keys to move your character. Pressing the key down moves the character continuously and faster.

The bugs move at randomly chosen speeds. Refreshing the page reset their speeds.

Good luck! ðŸ¤ž
