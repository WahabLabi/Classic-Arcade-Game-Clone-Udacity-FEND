- Choose an avatar
- Use the arrow keys to avoid the speeding bugs, safely cross the thoroughfare and reach the water 
- You have three lives
- Success (reaching the water) = 10 points
- Failure (being hit by a bug) = lose a life and one point and being returned to the starting position
- The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every success or failure

## Access and Installation

You can access and play the game by [clicking here][1] or download/clone this repo and then open the index.html file.

## Development

This game was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. They provided the game engine and resources and then I used my object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) skills to make it all work.

Skills developed:

- OOJS
- ES6 (especially the use of classes)
- DOM manipulation
- CSS styling
- Game development (especially 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms)
