# Udacity-FEND-arcade-game

This game is one of my projects for the Front End Developer Nanodegree that I'm doing at Udacity (https://eu.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). Udacity provided the game engine and resources and then I used my object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) skills to make it all work. I used ES6 classes and also carried out some DOM manipulation and CSS styling. Ultimately I further developed my OOJS skills and learned about game development, in particular things such as 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms.

The game is based on the arcade hit Frogger. You can choose one of five avatars at any time and have three lives. You can move your avatar using your keyboard arrow keys.

Your objective is to safely cross a busy thoroughfare, which is traversed by speeding bugs, and reach the water' edge beyond. If you're successful then you'll be rewarded with 10 points. However if a bug hits you then you will lose a life, get a point deducted and then have to restart. 

The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every collision or success.

In order to play the game you have to download or clone this repo and then open the index.html file.

I hope you enjoy it! ðŸ˜€
