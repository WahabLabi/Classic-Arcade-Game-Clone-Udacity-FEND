# Udacity-FEND-arcade-game

This is a game based on the arcade hit Frogger.

During the game you are in control of a character and your objective is to safely cross a busy thoroughfare and reach the water' edge beyond - achieving this objctive will result in a reward of 10 points. The thoroughfare is traversed by speeding bugs and if they hit you then you will lose a life, a point and have to restart. 

You can choose one of five characters at any time and have three lives. Use your keyboard arrow keys to move your character. Pressing and holding an arrow key down moves the character continuously and faster in that direction.

The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every collision or success.

In order to play the game you have to download or clone this repo. Once you've got the code on your local machine then please navigate to and then open the index.html file to see the game.

I built this game as part of my Udacity Front End Nanodegree. I was provided with a game engine and resources and then had to use my JavaScript Object-oriented coding skills to complete the game (and some HTML and CSS). I used ES6 classes as syntactic sugar over a prototype-based inheritance foundation.

Enjoy and good luck! ðŸ¤ž
