- Choose one of five avatars
- Use your keyboard arrow keys to avoid the bugs, safely cross the thoroughfare and reach the water 
- You have three lives
- Success = 10 points
- Failure (being hit by a bug) = lose a life and one point and returned to the starting position
- The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every collision or success.

## Background

This game is one of my projects for the Front End Developer Nanodegree that I'm doing at [Udacity][2]. Udacity provided the game engine and resources and then I used my object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) skills to make it all work. I used ES6 classes and also carried out some DOM manipulation and CSS styling. Overall it was a good opportunity to further develop my OOJS skills and learn about game development, in particular things such as 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms.
