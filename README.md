- Choose an avatar by clicking on it
- You can move your avatar using the arrow keys
- Your aim is to reach the water by crossing the busy thoroughfare whilst evading the bugs
- You have three lives
- Success (reaching the water) = 10 points
- Failure (being hit by a bug) = having a life and one point deducted and restarting
- The bugs move at random speeds which are reset after every success or failure

## Access and Installation

You can play the game by [clicking here][1] or by downloading/cloning this repo and then opening the index.html file.

## Development

This game was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. They provided the game engine and resources and then I used my object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) skills to make it work perfectly.

Skills developed:

- OOJS
- ES6 (especially the use of classes)
- DOM manipulation
- CSS styling
- Game development (especially 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms)
